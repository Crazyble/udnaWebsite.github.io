            A clock or a timepiece is a device used to measure and indicate time. The clock is
            one of the oldest
            human
            inventions, meeting the need to measure intervals of time shorter than the natural units such as the day,
            the
            lunar
            month and the year. Devices operating on several physical processes have been used over the millennia.

            Some predecessors to the modern clock may be considered as "clocks" that are based on movement in nature: A
            sundial
            shows the time by displaying the position of a shadow on a flat surface. There is a range of duration
            timers, a
            well-known example being the hourglass. Water clocks, along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest
            time-measuring
            instruments. A major advance occurred with the invention of the verge escapement, which made possible the
            first
            mechanical clocks around 1300 in Europe, which kept time with oscillating timekeepers like balance
            wheels.[2][3][4][5]
