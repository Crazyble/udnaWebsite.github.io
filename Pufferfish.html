    <h2>Number 1</h2>
    <p>
        The pufferfish is a family of fish, with about 100 species. They are also known as the blowfish, fugu,
        swellfish, and
        globefish. They are called the pufferfish because when they are threatened, they puff up to about twice their
        normal
        size by gulping water. In this enlarged state, the pufferfish can swim at only about half their normal speed.
        Pufferfish
        are generally believed to be the second-most poisonous vertebrates in the world, after the golden poison frog.
        They use
        tetrodotoxin, a powerful neurotoxin.

        Most pufferfish are found in sub-tropical and tropical marine waters (including coral reefs) in the Atlantic,
        Pacific,
        and Indian Oceans. Some pufferfish live in brackish and fresh water.

        The scientific name refers to the four large teeth, fused into an upper and lower plate, which are used for
        crushing the
        shells of crustaceans and mollusks, their natural prey.
